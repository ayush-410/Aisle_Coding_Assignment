To implement the logic of refreshing daily likes for millions of users from over 150 countries in a scalable way, we can follow the following steps:

1.We can maintain user's data in a database that keeps track of each user's remaining daily likes, last refresh time, and their time zone.
2.As each user is in a different time zone, we need to calculate the local time of 12:00 pm in their respective time zones.
3.We can set up a scheduled job that runs at a fixed time every day, preferably at 12:00 pm (noon), UTC time. This scheduled job will be responsible for refreshing the daily likes for all users.
4.For each user, we can update their remaining likes count to the maximum value (e.g., 10) since it's a daily refresh.
  We can update the last refresh timestamp to the current time.
5.To optimize the process, we can employ caching mechanisms to reduce database load. For example, we could store user likes data in an in-memory cache or a distributed cache system.
